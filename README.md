# Personal site

My simple and clean personal website to make myself better visible online. It uses a customized form of the [minimal](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) Jekyll theme in combination with a MarkDown file in which I added all the information.

## Liking the design? Try it out!

If you are inspired and would like to use the minimal theme with the changes I made, then feel free create a fork of this repo! After this, you have to change the name of the repo into `your-github-username.github.io`and then setting up the Github Pages withing the settings of the repo.
